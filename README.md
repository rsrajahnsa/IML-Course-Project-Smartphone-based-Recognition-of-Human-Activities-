### SMARTPHONE BASED RECOGNITION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES

- Worked on processing of raw data that included acceleration and angular velocities of a personâ€™s arm
movement in three directions.
- The data was derived from accelerometer and gyroscopic measurements
- The preprocessed and normalized data was used to train machine learning models for predicting the activity
performed by the user at a given point in time.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis by using various models such as PCA, LDA, SVM, t-SNE as well as using
some time series models such as ARMA, ARIMA etc.
- Also worked on hybrid models to improve the accuracy.
- Completed the project with an impressive accuracy of 95.16% by using SVM model with linear kernel
